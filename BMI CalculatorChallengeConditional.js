/* If my weight is 65Kg and my height is 1.8m, I should be able to call your function like this:
var bmi = bmiCalculator(65, 1.8); 

bmi should equal around 20 in this case.
The formula is BMI = kg/m2 where kg is a personâ€™s weight in kilograms and m2 is their height in metres squared.

if the BMI is <18.5, the output should be: "Your BMI is <bmi>, so you are underweight." 
if the BMI is 18.5 - 24.9, the output should be: "Your BMI is <bmi>, so you have a normal weight." 
if the BMI is >24.9, the output should be: "Your BMI is <bmi>, so you are overweight."
